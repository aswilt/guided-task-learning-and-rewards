# Architecture Overview

## Components

1. **Task Guidance Engine**: Manages multi-step workflows, tracks progress, supports branching  
2. **Learning Module**: Delivers contextual micro-learning content; API-driven integration  
3. **Reward Engine**: Configurable points, streaks, and milestone rewards  
4. **Rules Engine**: Governs task-to-reward relationships, modular design

## Integration Pattern

- Stub APIs simulate external system interactions
- Event-driven, decoupled design for scalability

## TPM Notes

- Shows translation of business needs into technical architecture
- Enables engineering teams to implement a scalable system
