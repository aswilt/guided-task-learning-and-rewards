# PM Case Study

## Context

In large organizations, employees often receive tasks from leadership or HR management that are critical but not engaging. Many users either fail to complete these tasks on time or struggle to understand the required steps. Traditional training programs fail to deliver guidance at the point of need, and managers lack visibility into progress or completion.  

This project addresses the need for **guided workflows, embedded learning, and configurable rewards**, while allowing oversight by leadership or management to emphasize urgent actions. Administrators can allocate reward pathways for a configurable period to drive engagement and timely completion.

---

## Problem Statement

- Employees often do not engage with or complete critical HR, finance, or operational tasks.  
- Managers have limited visibility into task completion and employee progression.  
- Existing training is separate from workflows and fails to provide step-by-step guidance.  
- Engagement and adoption of organizational tools is inconsistent.  

---

## Approach

### Solution Design

- Designed a modular system that integrates **guided workflows, embedded micro-learning, and gamified rewards**.  
- Implemented an **event-driven architecture** with a rules engine to govern rewards and configurable admin oversight.  
- Integrated conceptual stubs for external learning and workflow APIs, demonstrating TPM-level planning for decoupled, scalable design.  

### User Experience and Iteration

- Conducted **user experience sessions** with representative employees to observe workflow pain points and identify friction areas.  
- Facilitated **refinement and feedback workshops** with HR, finance, and leadership teams to validate task guidance content, reward structures, and workflow sequencing.  
- Iteratively improved task flows, reward logic, and learning content based on real user feedback, ensuring both usability and engagement.  

### Decision-Making

- Chose a **points-and-guided-learning approach** rather than full automation to maintain transparency and provide flexibility for managerial oversight.  
- Prioritized modularity in the backend and API design to allow future expansion to other workflow or learning systems.  
- Designed configurable reward pathways to allow leadership to emphasize urgent tasks without disrupting the core guidance experience.

---

## Outcome / Expected Impact

- Expected increase in task completion rates, particularly for complex or non-engaging tasks.  
- Improved employee confidence and knowledge retention through embedded learning.  
- Administrators gain **insight and control** over workflow progress and reward allocation.  
- Provides a clear blueprint for engineers to implement a scalable, decoupled system.  

---

## Key Takeaways

- Demonstrates **TPM capabilities**: translating business requirements into modular system design, coordinating with stakeholders, and guiding engineering implementation.  
- Highlights ability to **use feedback loops and iterative refinement** to deliver a solution that balances usability, engagement, and administrative oversight.  
- Serves as a strong portfolio example of managing **technical product design and human-centered workflow optimization**.
